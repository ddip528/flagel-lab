Flagel was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, came to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, and never left. Dr. Flagel became involved in research through the <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program</a> conducted an undergraduate thesis project under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/directory/profiles/faculty/?uniquename=liberzon" target="_blank">Dr. Israel Liberzon</a>, and graduated with High Honors in Psychology as a Natural Science. She then matriculated into the <a href="http://neuroscience.med.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience Graduate Program</a> and conducted her graduate thesis work under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~vazquezd/" target="_blank">Drs. Delia Vazquez</a> and <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/terryrobinson/home" target="_blank">Terry Robinson</a>. Her thesis project examined the effects of early life stress on drug-taking behavior in adulthood. After obtaining her PhD, Dr. Flagel joined the laboratory of <a href="http://www.mbni.med.umich.edu/mbni/faculty/akil/akil.html" target="_blank">Dr. Huda Akil</a> and conducted her postdoctoral training at the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan. Dr. Flagel "opened" her lab in the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan in 2011 and is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry. In addition to "doing science", Dr. Flagel enjoys being the mom of two young boys, the outdoors, exercising and travelling.</p></div></div><!--

During his studies he worked in the laboratory of 'Developmental Psychobiology and Behavioral Genetics' under the mentorship of Prof. Simona Cabib, where he studied how the impact of a previous stress history alters the behavioral and neural adaptations to environmental challenges in different inbred mouse strains. In December 2014 Paolo received his Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from Sapienza University, with a dissertation titled "A genotype-environment interaction modulates the involvement of different memory systems in the consolidation of stress related memories." In September 2015 Paolo came to Ann Arbor to join the Flagel Lab as a post-doctoral fellow. His current research interests are focused on the study of the brain mechanisms underlying maladaptive behaviors and the study of individual differences in liability to drug addiction. In his spare time, Paolo loves playing guitar, listening to rock music and home-recording.</p></div></div><!--

His thesis examined the contribution of methamphetamine-induced dysfunctions in the corticostriatal pathway to persistent drug seeking behavior. He is now a postdoctoral fellow in Dr. Huda Akil’s laboratory, and collaborates with the Flagel Lab on a regular basis. Aram’s overall research interest is to understand how environment, behavioral experiences, and neurobiological factors contribute to susceptibility for neuropsychiatric conditions including mood disorders and drug addiction.</p></div></div><!--
