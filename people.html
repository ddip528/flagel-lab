Flagel was born and raised in Middletown, Ohio, came to Ann Arbor to attend the University of Michigan as an undergraduate, and never left. Dr. Flagel became involved in research through the <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/urop/" target="_blank">Undergraduate Research Opportunity Program</a> conducted an undergraduate thesis project under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.lsa.umich.edu/psych/people/directory/profiles/faculty/?uniquename=liberzon" target="_blank">Dr. Israel Liberzon</a>, and graduated with High Honors in Psychology as a Natural Science. She then matriculated into the <a href="http://neuroscience.med.umich.edu/" target="_blank">Neuroscience Graduate Program</a> and conducted her graduate thesis work under the mentorship of <a href="http://www.umich.edu/~vazquezd/" target="_blank">Drs. Delia Vazquez</a> and <a href="http://sitemaker.umich.edu/terryrobinson/home" target="_blank">Terry Robinson</a>. Her thesis project examined the effects of early life stress on drug-taking behavior in adulthood. After obtaining her PhD, Dr. Flagel joined the laboratory of <a href="http://www.mbni.med.umich.edu/mbni/faculty/akil/akil.html" target="_blank">Dr. Huda Akil</a> and conducted her postdoctoral training at the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan. Dr. Flagel "opened" her lab in the Molecular and Behavioral Neuroscience Institute at the University of Michigan in 2011 and is now an Associate Professor in the Department of Psychiatry.

During his studies he worked in the laboratory of 'Developmental Psychobiology and Behavioral Genetics' under the mentorship of Prof. Simona Cabib, where he studied how the impact of a previous stress history alters the behavioral and neural adaptations to environmental challenges in different inbred mouse strains. In December 2014 Paolo received his Ph.D. in Behavioral Neuroscience from Sapienza University, with a dissertation titled "A genotype-environment interaction modulates the involvement of different memory systems in the consolidation of stress related memories." In September 2015 Paolo came to Ann Arbor to join the Flagel Lab as a post-doctoral fellow. His current research interests are focused on the study of the brain mechanisms underlying maladaptive behaviors and the study of individual differences in liability to drug addiction. In his spare time, Paolo loves playing guitar, listening to rock music and home-recording.</p></div></div><!--

While at CSUF, she participated in the Maximizing Access to Research Careers program under the mentorship of Dr. Jennifer Trevitt; where she studied the effects of a western diet and physical activity on anxiety and learning. Amanda joined the Program in Biomedical Sciences at the University of Michigan and matriculated into the Neuroscience Graduate Program in the fall of 2017. Her research interests include the complex biological mechanisms and subcortical, hypothalamic neural circuitry that may subserve individual differences in cue-motivated behaviors. And, more specifically, how these differences can help us understand maladaptive behaviors related to reward and motivation, such as drug addiction.

After graduating in 2013, he began volunteering in Israel Liberzon’s lab at the University of Michigan where he studied the effects of Single Prolonged Stress on fear learning and retention. His interest in behavioral neuroscience and individual differences drew him to the P50 project, a collaborative effort between Dr. Flagel and Dr. Terry Robinson, as well as others at other institutions (<a href="http://ratgenes.org/" target="_blank">ratgenes.org</a>). The primary goal of the P50 project is to investigate genetic factors underlying behavioral phenotypes related to addiction, specifically the attribution of incentive salience to a reward cue. Aidan’s long term goal is to obtain a PhD and guide future generations of scientists as a teacher and researcher. His other pursuits include various creative ventures such as animation and music writing.</p></div></div><!--
